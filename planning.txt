First think I am starting with is making a plan. I came with idea to create ticketmaster API using free resource to get all data.json from here: https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/events.json?countryCode=US&apikey=ZwX9RHpLG7IGWGNyWGI1O1dra8fS4fB0.
Than I have decided to create my models, looking at my data which I get from Postman in a piece of paper. Now it's time to create an Express App. 

On terminal:
    mkdir APP-project
    cd APP-project
    npm install express
    npm install mongoose
    npm install body-parser

First thing to do after installing everything is to set up index.js and run node index.js to see is server running.
Than it's time to start creating folders for project.

On terminal:
    mkdir models controllers routes
    cd models
    touch Event.js Attraction.js Venues.js
    code .

Time to think about how I will initialize my models....
.clean up my data.json so it will matches with my models field as much as I can 
.seed my data 
.look an mango shell is there any collections
.whenever my data is seeded start thinking about controllers and routes

Now when I get all my events and tested that out on Postman and GET works, I need to 
create other methods and test them out as well.

Add some more fields on Event models
Add description for all methods for Event inside README
Push everything to GitHub
Deploy to Heroku
And only after all, add AJAX and JQuery to make it look pretty:)
